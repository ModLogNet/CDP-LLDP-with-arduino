# CDP-LLDP-with-arduino
This repository is for the CDP project originally started here: http://www.modlog.net/?p=907 and then revisited and LLDP added here: http://www.modlog.net/?p=1591

The original code was by Chris van Marle - CDPSniffino: https://github.com/qistoph/CdpSniffino. It was butchered to suit the ENC28J60 chipset with a red PCB ST7735 LCD.
